                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>
                    GrocerMate was developed to address the challenges faced by busy households in managing grocery shopping efficiently. In today’s fast-paced lifestyle, people often struggle with forgotten items, lack of coordination among family members, and time wasted on unorganized trips.

                <h2>Problem</h2>
                <p>

                    Households often face several challenges when managing groceries, which can lead to inefficiencies and unnecessary stress. A common issue is the lack of shared shopping lists, resulting in duplicate purchases or missed items. Poor coordination among household members during shopping trips further complicates matters, making it difficult to ensure everyone’s needs are met. Additionally, people often forget to shop when they are near a store, missing convenient opportunities to purchase essentials. Time inefficiency also arises from scattered grocery planning and tracking, which can disrupt schedules and create unnecessary frustration. Together, these problems waste valuable time and money while adding to the stress of daily life.
                </p>
                <h2>Goals</h2>
                <p>
                    The goal is to create an app that simplifies grocery shopping for households by addressing common challenges and promoting efficiency. The app will enhance collaboration through shared lists and scheduling features, ensuring that all household members are on the same page. Location-based reminders will help users complete tasks on time, making it easier to shop when near a store. By focusing on a seamless and intuitive user experience, the app will streamline the shopping process. Additionally, it will reduce waste by preventing duplicate purchases and ensuring that no essential items are missed.

                <h2>User Scenario</h2>
                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p>Jeffery is an engineer with a full schedule. He often struggles to find time for grocery shopping. He shares a household with his partner, Jenny, who is also doing a 9 to 5 job, and they split the grocery responsibilities between them.
                </p>
                <h3>Scenario</h3>
                <p>Today Jeffery has two meetings: one before the lunch break and one after 4 PM. He finishes his first meeting and is about to go for lunch when he receives a geofence triggered notification from the app. This notification reminds him of the items in his grocery list that need to be purchased and can be purchased from the grocery store near his office. As the grocery management app has given him the notification syncing with his calendar, his next meeting is 3 hours later, he has enough time to pick the items on the list before the next meeting starts. Jeffery buys all the items in the suggested list by the app and tick marks all of them so that the app notifies Jenny about the items that have been already bought. Jeffery is able to finish shopping quickly and does not miss any of the essential groceries that could be found on his way home today.</p>
